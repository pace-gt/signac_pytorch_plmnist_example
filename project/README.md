## Project directory
--------------------

## Overview

All the `signac` commands are run from the `<local_path>/signac_pytorch_plmnist_example/signac_pytorch_plmnist_example/project` directory, which include, but are not limited to the following commands:


- The signac workflows for "this project" can be built using `mamba`.  Alternatively, you use can use `micromamba` or `miniforge`,  supplimenting `micromamba` or `conda`, respectively for `mamba` when using them.  

If you are using an HPC, you will likely need the below command or a similar command to load the correct python package manager.  

```bash
module load mamba
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
mamba activate plmnist
```

The `signac init` command can be done at the start of a new project, but is not always required. If you moved the directory after starting a project or signac can not find the path correctly, you may need to run the following command (`signac init`) from the `project` directory:

```bash
signac init
```

 - State point initialization.

```bash
python init.py
```

 - Checking the project status.
 
```bash
row show status
```

### **Option 1 of 2: Check and Submit and run all the available jobs from all the parts.**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1. See the `row show status` output for the part names.
   2. Note: This can be run on the HPC or locally.  However, if `row submit` is run locally like this, then you must remove the HPC parts in the `workflow.toml` file (see the notes in the `workflow.toml`).

   **Run the following command and test/review the output to make sure it is submitting the correct slurm scripts or local output:**

   ```bash
   row submit --dry-run
   ```

   **Run the following command to submit or execute all the available jobs:**

   ```bash
    row submit
   ```

### **Option 2 of 2: Check and Submit all the available jobs from specific the parts.**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. See the `row show status` output for the part names.
  2. Note: This can be run on the HPC or locally.  However, if `row submit` is run locally like this, then you must remove the HPC parts in the `workflow.toml` file (see the notes in the `workflow.toml`).

   **Run the following command and review the output to make sure it is submitting the correctslurm scripts or local output:**:**
   ```bash
   row submit --action <part_x_this_does_a_function_y> --dry-run
   ```

   **Run the following command to submit or execute all the available jobs for that part:**
   ```bash
   row submit --action <part_x_this_does_a_function_y>
   ```

## Submit the workflow jobs locally or to an HPC, depending on the `workflow.toml` file setup. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please also look [here](https://row.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.0/workflow/action/submit-options.html) for more details on the HPC setup.

## Setup the Run this project.

All commands in this section are run from the `<local_path>/signac_pytorch_plmnist_example/signac_pytorch_plmnist_example/project` directory.

The `signac init` command can be done at the start of a new project, but is not always required. If you moved the directory after starting a project or signac can not find the path correctly, you will need to run the following command (`signac init`) from the `project` directory:

```bash
signac init
```

In general, check the status of the workflows buy running `row show status` and `row submit --dry-run` before each submission to ensure each workflow part is not written in a way that is computationally expensive.  

```bash
row show status
```

```bash
row submit --dry-run
```

Initialize all the state points for the jobs (generate all the separate folders and state points).  
 - Note: This command generates the `workspace` folder, which includes a sub-folder for each state point (different variable or replicate combinations),  These sub-folders are numbered uniquely based of the state point values.  The user can add more state points via the `init.py` file at any time, running the below command to create the new state points files and sub-folders that are in the `init.py` file.

```bash
python init.py
```

Check the status of your project (i.e., what parts are completed and what parts are available to be run).

```bash
row show status
```

## These are two (2) different ways to submit jobs (see below):

1. ### **Option 1 of 2: Submit and ruun all the available jobs from all the parts with `row submit`:**
   - Run `all available jobs for the whole project` locally with the `submit` command. 
Note: This needs to be done for each part as it only submits the available parts to the scheduler.

```bash
row submit
```

 - Check the project status and move forward when the next part is ready to be submitted.
  
```bash
row show status
```

- When the new jobs are ready, repeat this cycle until all jobs and the project is completed.  If all completed, the project is completed sucessfully. If not, you may need to rerun some parts.
   
  
2. ### **Option 2 of 2: Submit and and run all the available jobs from specific the part with `row submit --action <part_x_this_does_a_function_y>`:**
 - Run all available `part 1` sections of the project locally with the `submit` command.

```bash
row submit --action part_1_initialize_signac_command
```

 - Check the project status and move forward when the next part is ready to be submitted.
   
```bash
row show status
```

 - Run all available `part 2` sections of the project locally with the `submit` command.

```bash
row submit --action part_2_download_data_command
```

 - Check the project status and move forward when the next part is ready to be submitted.
   
```bash
row show status
```

 - Run all available `part 3` sections of the project locally with the `submit` command.

```bash
row submit --action part_3_verify_main_data_downloaded_command
```

 - Check the project status and move forward when the next part is ready to be submitted.
   
```bash
row show status
```

 - Run all available `part 4` sections of the project locally with the `submit` command.

```bash
row submit --action part_4_train_and_test_command
```

 - Check the project status and move forward when the next part is ready to be submitted.

  
```bash
row show status
```

 - Run all available `part 5` sections of the project locally with the `submit` command.

```bash
row submit --action part_5_fgsm_attack_command
```

 - Check the project status and move forward when the next part is ready to be submitted.
   
```bash
row show status
```

 - Run all available `part 6` sections of the project locally with the `submit` command.

```bash
row submit --action part_6_seed_analysis_command
```

 - Check the project status and make sure all parts are completed.  If all completed, the project is completed sucessfully. If not, you may need to rerun some parts.
   
```bash
row show status
```

## Documention References:

- See the [sigac documenation](https://docs.signac.io/) for more information, features, and the how to populate the workspace with the init.py file.
- See the [row documenation](https://row.readthedocs.io/) for information on setting up and executing the workflows and job submissions. 

## IMPORTANT NOTES:
- `Row` status tracking is done only by looking for specific files located in the `workspace/*/` directories (i.e., for each state point).

- When using the `row submit` command, you can run utilize flags to control the how the jobs are submitted. 

- `Warning`, the user should always confirm the job submission to the HPC is working properly before submitting jobs using the `--dry-run` flag.  This may involve programming the correct items in the custom submission script or the python execution file (i.e., the `workflow.toml` or `actions.py` file) as needed to make it work for their unique setup.
